# Notification System

A modern, interactive notification list built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It features hover-to-delete functionality, accept/decline actions for pending notifications, and a clean, centered UI design.

## Approach
I utilised shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility, with custom color schemes and smooth transitions to provide an intuitive user experience. I also utilised TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality. This project is also scalable and maintainable because it uses a commonly used full-stack framework, Next.js.

## Features
- Interactive notification management (accept/decline/delete)
- Hover-based delete functionality
- Responsive centered layout
- Custom avatar colors and status indicators
- Smooth animations and transitions
